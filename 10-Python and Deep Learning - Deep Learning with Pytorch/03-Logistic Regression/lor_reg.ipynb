    "## Logistic Regression\n",
    "- Linear regression is not good at classification.\n",
    "- We use logistic regression for classification.\n",
    "- linear regression + logistic function(softmax) = logistic regression\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Steps of Logistic Regression**\n",
    "    1. Import Libraries\n",
    "    2. Prepare Dataset\n",
    "        - We use MNIST dataset.\n",
    "        - There are 28*28 images and 10 labels from 0 to 9\n",
    "        - Data is not normalized so we divide each image to 255 that is basic normalization for images.\n",
    "        - In order to split data, we use train_test_split method from sklearn library\n",
    "        - Size of train data is 80% and size of test data is 20%.\n",
    "        - Create feature and target tensors. At the next parts we create variable from these tensors. As you remember we need to define variable for accumulation of gradients.\n",
    "        - batch_size = batch size means is that for example we have data and it includes 1000 sample. We can train 1000 sample in a same time or we can divide it 10 groups which include 100 sample and train 10 groups in order. Batch size is the group size. For example, I choose batch_size = 100, that means in order to train all data only once we have 336 groups. We train each groups(336) that have batch_size(quota) 100. Finally we train 33600 sample one time.\n",
    "        - epoch: 1 epoch means training all samples one time.\n",
    "        - In our example: we have 33600 sample to train and we decide our batch_size is 100. Also we decide epoch is 29(accuracy achieves almost highest value when epoch is 29). Data is trained 29 times. Question is that how many iteration do I need? Lets calculate: \n",
    "            - training data 1 times = training 33600 sample (because data includes 33600 sample) \n",
    "            - But we split our data 336 groups(group_size = batch_size = 100) our data \n",
    "            - Therefore, 1 epoch(training data only once) takes 336 iteration\n",
    "            - We have 29 epoch, so total iterarion is 9744(that is almost 10000 which I used)\n",
    "        - TensorDataset(): Data set wrapping tensors. Each sample is retrieved by indexing tensors along the first dimension.\n",
    "        - DataLoader(): It combines dataset and sample. It also provides multi process iterators over the dataset.\n",
    "        - Visualize one of the images in dataset\n",
    "    3. Create Logistic Regression Model\n",
    "        - Same with linear regression.\n",
    "        - However as you expect, there should be logistic function in model right?\n",
    "        - In pytorch, logistic function is in the loss function where we will use at next parts.\n",
    "    4. Instantiate Model\n",
    "        - input_dim = 28*28 # size of image px*px\n",
    "        - output_dim = 10  # labels 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\n",
    "        - create model\n",
    "    5. Instantiate Loss \n",
    "        - Cross entropy loss\n",
    "        - It calculates loss that is not surprise :)\n",
    "        - It also has softmax(logistic function) in it.\n",
    "    6. Instantiate Optimizer \n",
    "        - SGD Optimizer\n",
    "    7. Traning the Model\n",
    "    8. Prediction\n",
    "- As a result, as you can see from plot, while loss decreasing, accuracy(almost 85%) is increasing and our model is learning(training).    "
